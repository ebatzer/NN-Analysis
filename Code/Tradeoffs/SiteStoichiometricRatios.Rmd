# How do sites vary in their nutrient resource profiles?

As a starting point, I characterized sites by their resource availability to get a
better sense of the variation in resource supply across sites, as well as
correlation between the three potential limiting resources manipulated through
fertilization.

# Calculating site stoichiometric ratios

To characterize sites by their relative resource supply and imbalance, we can
calculate both the total amount of resources available in a given site, as well
as the relative imbalance of these ratios, per Cardinale et al. (2009).

In this method, site resource concentrations of any $n$ nutrients are standardized
to their $z$-scores, then projected onto a vector ($\vec{1}$) that represents
a perfect balance of resource stoichiometry.

In a two-resource example, see panel (a) in the figure below from Lewandoska et al. (2016)

This schematic shows some site resource concentrations in resources 1 and 2, denoted by the vector $r$, projected upon a "perfectly balanced" vector denoted by $a$. The length of this projection, $a$, represents total resource supply in the system, while the orthogonal vector, $b$ represents resource imbalance.

As an aside, I think there's an error in the caption of this figure, where $b$ is listed as  a function of cosh(), which should produce an angle, $\theta$. This measure of  $\theta$ is likely what is actually being used, as is the case in the original Cardinale et al 2009. I've listed the formula below:

$$\theta = \cos^{-1}\frac{(\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y})}{\left\lVert\vec{x}
\right\rVert \left\lVert\vec{y}\right\rVert} = \cos^{-1}\frac{a}{r}$$

I haven't seen this done before in other publications, but I believe we can also use this information to figure out
what is limiting relative to this ideal stoichiometric ratio. The vector $b$, which is the portion of our observed vector $r$ that is not accounted for by the projection onto $a$ can be termed the "rejection", defined simply by $b = r - a$

```{r}
# Stoichiometric ratio function (from Lewandosta et al. 2016)
stoichrat <- function(x){
  
  xvec = as.numeric(x)

  y = rep(1, length(xvec))
  
  a = sum(xvec * y) / sqrt(sum(y))
  
  r = sqrt(sum(xvec^2))
  
  # "A" vector
  avec = sum(xvec * y) / sqrt(sum(y)) * (y / sqrt(sum(y)))
  names(avec) = c("a_N", "a_P", "a_K", "a_C")
  
  # "B" vector
  bvec = c(xvec - avec)
  names(bvec) = c("b_N", "b_P", "b_K", "a_C")
  
  b = sqrt(sum(bvec^2))

  if(a >= 0){
    theta = acos(a/r) * (180 / pi)
  }else if(a < 0){
    theta = 180 - acos(a/r) * (180 / pi)
  }else{
    error("There's a problem!")
  }
  
  output <- list(a, theta, r, b, avec, bvec)
  names(output) = c("a", "theta", "r", "b", "avec", "bvec")
  
  return(output)
}

resources = soil.zscores %>% 
  select(pct_N, ppm_P, ppm_K, pct_C)

stoichtable = bind_cols(soil.zscores %>%
