A suggested way to tease apart what makes certain species more likely to respond 
positively to different nutrient enrichment treatments is through some variety 
of decision tree.

When we have a set of hierarchical predictors that range from site-level predictors
(precip, temp, species richness) to more individual-level predictors (functional 
type, relative rank abundance), decision trees can offer a reasonably intuitive 
way to model and interpet interactions between them.

```{r}
load("dotoutput.Rdata")

library(tidyverse)

head(specscores_full)

head(bind_cols(attr.mat, cover.mat))

specscores_full %>% gather(key = species,
                           value = effect, 
                           -c("site", "trt"))

# Mean control cover of each species:
cover.long %>% 
  group_by(Taxon, site_code) %>%
  filter(trt == "Control") %>%
  summarise(meancov = mean(max_cover))



```
