Re-run models as SEM?

Start with site-level predictors of biomass and variance in biomass

- Precipitation deficit (PET - PTo?) or function of MAP + MAT
- Soil resources (N, P, K, C, pH)
- Disturbance + management
- Invasion history?

Use these to predict site-level biomass, then also estimate variance in productivity by variance in these site-level predictors? How to best link soil resources to biomass?

- Then, link between these other drivers, biomass, and distribution of diversity within each site?

Plot partial correlations between resource heterogeneity + supply on turnover / diversity?

## Follow with plot of diversity partitioning as a function of difference in productivity

Is beta-diversity driven by changes in nestedness within each sites (species packing?) or turnover (different affinities to competitive environment / soil conditions)
