## Nutrient Network Resource Use Tradeoff Analysis

Analyses associated with work at the [Nutrient Network](http://www.nutnet.umn.edu/), a global collaborative experiment consisting of replicated fertilization and herbivore removal treatments across 6 continents.

## Main Projects

__Tradeoffs:__ Examining the relative similarity of community change in response to different fertilization treatments. When multiple fertilizers affect communities, are the same species responding positively? Where are there tradeoffs in fertilization response?

__DivTurnover:__ Exploring the relationship between soil and climatic nutrient availability, resource heterogeneity, and the species diversity of global grassland systems.
